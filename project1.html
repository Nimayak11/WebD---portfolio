<h1>The best movies according to Navya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>I am not really into movies but this 4 hour flick kept me hooked throughout! Real and the direction was quite impactful.</p>
<h3>3 idiots</h3>
<p>Probably an all India faourite, this movie took away my heart with its simple yet strong script that really hit home. The actors were fabulous as well.</p>
<h3>Amar prem</h3>
<p>I have a whole lot of childhood memories linked to this movie. Plus, the storyline is an easy 8.5/10. Rajesh Khanna,the male protagonist was one of the top Indian actors that I really admire (I was a huge fan!!). We had bought a CD that had this and 2 other movies stored in it (timeline - 2000s) and I remember rewatching them with my parents atleast once every year, lol. Can't imagine rewatching a movie anymore though. It's just not my thing.</p>
